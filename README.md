DiscoverNaija Movies! 
The Idea

Not everyone can afford paid streaming platforms like Netflix or Prime Video, and not every talented Nigerian filmmaker or storyteller can distribute their work there.

DiscoverNaija Movies! is a personalized movie discovery application that helps users explore curated YouTube movies and series from Nigeria, as well as global picks, including faith-based content and C-dramas.

The idea came from my love of watching movies and the desire to highlight high-quality, free content that often goes unnoticed. This platform shines a spotlight on hardworking creatives while also offering optional recommendations from paid platforms. Itâ€™s perfect for audiences looking for relaxing, fun, faith-based, and wholesome entertainment, all without a price tag.
