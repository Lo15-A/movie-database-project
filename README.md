#  DiscoverNaija Movies!

## Overview
**DiscoverNaija Movies!** is a movie discovery app built with React and Tailwind CSS.  
It currently allows users to **search for movies via the OMDb API**, view clickable posters, and navigate to a **movie details page** for more information.  

The project is the first step toward building a full movie discovery and streaming hub that will shine a spotlight on **Nigerian YouTube gems**, **faith-based films**, and other **global picks** that are often overlooked, and my original works.
