        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
Not everyone can afford a paid subscription to streaming platforms like Netflix or Prime Video etc, and not every great Nigerian filmmaker or storyteller can afford to distribute their work through these platforms either.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
This project is a personalized movie discovery application that helps users explore curated YouTube movies and series from Nigeria, as well as global picks, including faith-based content and C-dramas. The idea was born from my recent habit of watching lots of movies and wanting to highlight great, accessible content that often goes unnoticed especially free titles on YouTube.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
   It solves that by spotlighting high-quality, free Nigerian YouTube content while also offering optional recommendations for those with access to paid platforms.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
 This platform is designed to spotlight high-quality Nigerian movies and series available on YouTube, making it easier for audiences to discover relaxing, fun, faith-based, and wholesome content all without a price tag.
